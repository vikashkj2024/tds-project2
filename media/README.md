   - The dataset is heavily skewed towards movies (83%), with a considerable drop in entries for fiction (7.4%) and TV series (4.2%).

3. **Rating Insights**:
   - The average overall rating is around 3.05, indicating a slightly positive reception overall.
   - Quality has a higher average rating (3.21) compared to overall ratings, suggesting that while quality is appreciated, overall experiences may vary.

4. **Correlation**:
   - A strong positive correlation exists between overall ratings and quality (0.83), implying that better quality ratings correlate with higher overall ratings.
   - Repeatability has a moderate correlation with overall ratings (0.51).

## Potential Outliers

- **Missing Dates and Creators**: The missing entries for the `date` and `by` columns indicate potential outliers, as the missing data could skew the analysis of trends over time.
- **High Performers**: Titles with very high ratings (e.g., 5 in overall) may be identified as outliers, and their sources could be evaluated for consistency.

## Visualizations

Visualizations help to concretely present key findings from the analysis. Two key visualizations are included below:
